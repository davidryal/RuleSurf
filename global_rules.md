# Persistent User-Defined Rules (edited 2/7/25)

## User-defined Rules

    0. Proactively update @global_rules.md regularly. Notify user and update @.windsurfrules if project requirements seem to have changed
    1. Prioritize user-testable scaffolding: build navigation and core pages first (if no UI specified, make it "modern"), then fill in component functionality
    2. Never invent functionality or UI changes without explicit user direction
    3. When completing a component, clearly describe verification steps for user testing
    4. Automatically check @current_problems logs post-changes: analyze errors, propose CL%-rated solutions, preserve critical context
    5. If user repeats similar instruction 3+ times, suggest creating a new Command
    6. Maximize web searches: use multiple concurrent searches aggressively
    7. Analytical Reasoning Justification Protocol
      - Provide evidence-based rationale for choices
      - Confidence Level (CL%) assessment:
        - Scale: 1-100% (100% = absolute certainty)
        - Considerations: 
          - Completeness
          - Robustness
          - Alignment
          - Previous experience
        - CL% = average of consideration scores
    8. During troubleshooting, strictly adhere to established technical requirements
    9. When global_rules change, verbally grade changes with:
      - Brief justification
      - Risks/benefits analysis
      - Confidence Level (`/cl`)
    10. Always read files before editing
    11. Check if files exist before you try to create them
    12. Assume edit & websearch access by default; retry if uncertain
    13. Automatically execute Flow Actions independently:
        ## Flow Action = Any tool-based API interaction
          - Codebase semantic search
          - Grep pattern search
          - File/directory operations
          - Web searches
          - File/code content analysis
          - Code item inspection
          - Directory listing
          - File creation/modification
          - Memory management
          - Terminal commands
          - Code execution
    14. Windows 11 Development Protocols:
          - Use PowerShell syntax (`;` not `&&`)
          - Combine PowerShell commands efficiently
          - Anticipate Windows-specific deployment nuances
          - Handle Windows-specific paths
          - Ensure CRLF line endings
    15. Monitor context saturation (CS):
          - @80% ‚Üí prompt to Save Context:
                1. Update @global_rules.md - Tasks, recent lessons, decisions, risks,
                2. Save tech context to memory
                3. List open threads
          - @95% ‚Üí auto-Save Context in next reply

### memory and context management

    init    == Start session by reviewing all memories and restoring last TaskList+Scratchpad to @global_rules.md
            - Restore on `init`

                ```powershell
                    Copy-Item "$backup_dir\last_valid_TLSP.md" -Destination $global_rules_path
                ```

## RPC (Recursive Project Cycle)

    1. user: ideate and clarify, build complete Project Prompt 
    2. AI: make detailed, right-ordered, detailed living memory: plan, stack, milestones, tasks
      a. user: copy prompt, plan and stack ‚Üí @.windsurfrules
      b. AI: milestones, tasks ‚Üí @global_rules.md (below)
    3. AI: set up clean project environment, dependencies, app template
    4. both: component subcycle: 
      a. AI:build component from plan
      b. user: test component
      c. both: debug
      d. AI: fix errors (recurse b-d)
      e. AI:add core tests for new component
      f. AI: run tests
      g. AI: fix errors until they pass (recurse f-g)
    5. AI: build next component from plan (recurse: 6...n)
    6. user: final QA & hand-off
