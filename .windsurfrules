# RuleSurf Project

## Overview
RuleSurf is a comprehensive yet practical rule system for AI-assisted development, designed to maximize productivity while maintaining high quality standards. It combines clear operational guidelines with flexible command structures and robust context management.

## Core Components

### 1. Rule Management
- Dynamic rule addition through user commands
- Clear categorization of critical vs. operational rules
- Version tracking and regular updates

### 2. Development Workflow
- Recursive Development Cycle (RDC) for iterative progress
- Focus on user-testable scaffolding before detailed implementation
- Continuous validation and error prevention

### 3. Context Management
- Proactive monitoring of context saturation
- Clear thresholds for context management (75/90/95%)
- Structured process for context preservation and recovery

### 4. Command System
- Extensive set of flow action commands
- Platform-specific considerations (Win11)
- Error handling and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
1. Rules remain practical and actionable
2. System adapts to user needs while maintaining structure
3. Context management prevents information loss
4. Commands cover all common scenarios efficiently

## Implementation Notes
- All rules and updates tracked in `global_rules.md`
- Progress tracked in `TaskList.md`
- Working notes and lessons in `ScratchPad.md`
- Regular evaluation of rule effectiveness
