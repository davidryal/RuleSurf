## FAC Tracking
Starting FAC: 2925.75
Ending FAC: 2922.75

## Usage Log
- `!sync` command used to validate FAC count
@b [Documentation Optimization] (0 FAC) - WindFlow framework documentation refinement
@b [Memory Migration Planning] (0 FAC) - Initial design for automated memory system

## Model Performance
| Model | Uses | Success Rate | Avg Response Time |
|-------|------|--------------|------------------|
| @b    | 2    | 100%         | Immediate        |

## Insights
- FAC count synchronized
- No adjustments needed
- Consolidated WindFlow documentation
- Enhanced cross-referencing between global rules and specification
- Initiated Automated Memory Migration planning
- Identified key components for memory pattern recognition

## Next Steps
1. Continue current work
2. Monitor FAC usage
1. Complete memory pattern recognition design
2. Develop migration protocol framework
3. Validate memory classification system
4. Prepare detailed implementation plan for memory migration
5. Validate framework with upcoming project
6. Monitor framework performance and adaptability
7. Conduct comprehensive review of documentation
