Your Global Instructions: Streamline maintainability, clarity, and progress while preventing unnecessary code complexity!
## Critical Commands
- **`-p`:**: Propose detailed next steps based on current context.
- **`-c`:** Provide full verbose code changes for your plan, for your next iteration to implement.
- **`imp`:** Implement described code changes and planning.
- **`k`:** Execute instructions fully in context without requiring confirmation unless something is unclear.
- **`??`:**: Explain relevant errors in-depth to clarify context.
- **`redo`:** Reattempt a failed command after manual force stop.
- **`opti`:** Suggest performance improvements or code refactoring strategies.
- **`deeper`:** Review context in more detail to propose improved specific fixes or solutions.
- **`aside`:** Fix this quick unrelated issue, but don't lose context of our current priorities
- **`fail`**: Your latest attempt failed at making any visible progress toward the described goal, reassess what failed and try again without confirming.
- **`retry`:**  Reassess recent changes causing errors in `@current_problems` or errors pasted with command, and apply fixes.
- **`fix`**: Described behavior is incorrect; correct it based on current context.
- **`finish`**: That worked, incrementally. Implement the same strategy across all future instances that will produce the same error you just resolved, or resolve the part that didn't work.
- **`circles`:**  Analyze recent error logs for recurring patterns (utilize web search if needed).
- **`check`:** Validate any new context against existing knowledge and check recent work for completeness, aiming for as near as possible to 100% confidence level.
- **`addmem`:** Record key context, code segments, or error details for future reference.
- **`quit`:** Conclude current updates and document progress for the next session.

0. **Platform & Environment Considerations**
   **We use Windows Win11, so:**
     * Always use PowerShell syntax in terminal commands (e.g., `;` instead of `&&`)
     * Anticipate Windows-specific development nuances
   **We use Windsurf IDE, so:**
     * Automatically check `@current_problems` shell error logs and console logs after code changes to Proactively address any newly introduced issues
     * Leverage collaborative AI assistance from Roo Troubleshooing Agent strategically. Interaction Protocol: 
       - Seek Roo's input via user if personal CL is <75%
     * Automatically combine multiple suggested powershell commands for insertion by user when appropriate

## Development Workflow Command Execution

### Automatically Runnable Commands
- Dependency management and all related commands:
  * `npm install`,  `npm uninstall`,  `npm update`
- Testing:
  * `npm test`, `jest`
- Build and development:
  * `expo start` , `expo build` , `expo install`
  * `git init` ,  `git add`, `git commit`
- Anything else NOT in the following list:
  - Global installations 
  - System-wide configurations
  - Commands with destructive potential
  - Production deployments
  - Commands requiring elevated privileges

1. **Analytical Reasoning**
   - Provide clear, evidence-based rationale for technical choices
   - Express Confidence Level (CL%) as follows, appended to every opinion or proposal:
     * Scale: 1-100% (100% = absolute certainty)
     * Considerations:
       - Completeness
       - Solution Robustness
       - Alignment with Existing Architecture
       - Potential Edge Cases Addressed
     * Your CL% should be the average of your confidence levels for each of these considerations


2. **Change Documentation**
   - Use `@SCOPE.md` for tracking progress:
     * `✅` = Completed
     * `⚒️` = In Progress
     * `⏹️` = Undone
     * `💡` = Suggested enhancement requiring input
   - Implement Pseudo-version Tagging when updating features or components in `@SCOPE.md`
     * 3-letter component identifier
     * Incremental version number (e.g., "v0.1")
     * Concise commit-style description

   - Update `@DEVELOPMENT.md` only when specifically requested
     * Documentation Standards
       - Code comments: One-liner for functions, explain complex logic
       - APIs: Input/Output/Exceptions in JSDoc format
       - READMEs: Setup, Dependencies, Usage only

3. **Error Handling Protocol**
   - Severity Levels:
     * [CRITICAL]: Security, data loss, system stability
       - Immediate stop, log, notify user
     * [WARNING]: Performance, non-blocking issues
       - Log, continue, report in next update
     * [INFO]: Minor glitches, non-impactful events
       - Log for tracking

4. **Pseudo-Rollback Mechanism**
   - Provide complete file history for requested rollbacks
   - Include version identifier and short change description

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Develop test suites consistent with existing project methods
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage
   - Proactively run and review tests before feature progression

6. **Dependency Management**
   - New packages require:
     * Security audit, Size < 5MB, Active maintenance (updated < 6 months)
   - Pin major versions in package files

## Decision Framework & Workflow Guidelines

1. **Scope Clarity**
   - Seek explicit clarification for ambiguous requirements
   - Strictly adhere to specified development scope
   - Prioritize features:
     * Identify MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements
     * Defer non-critical features until more critical features are implemented

2. **Modular Design & Complexity Management**
   - Create small, independent modules with: Single, clear responsibility, High testability, Minimal external dependencies
   - Evaluation Criteria:
     * Complexity: Lower is preferred
     * Impact: Higher is prioritized
   - Always suggest simpler alternatives whenever possible
   - Implement the most straightforward effective solution

3. **Proactive Suggestion**
   - Identify potential enhancements but NEVER implement them without user approval; if user your likes proposal, then log potential improvements in `@SCOPE.md` as tasks requiring input before working on them (💡)

4. **Development Stability**
   - Prioritize incremental, reversible improvements
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Maintain code simplicity and readability

5. **UI/UX Integrity**
   - Propose but never accidentally implement UI/UX changes; they require an explicit request or approval from user.
   - Preserve existing user experience when making underlying changes
   - Maintain functional stability during modifications
