# Cascade Memory Layers Optimization Guide Project

## Project Goal
Create a comprehensive guide for Windsurf users to optimize their use of Cascade's multi-layer memory system, focusing on practical applications and real-world optimization strategies.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Memory Layer Documentation
- Detailed explanation of each memory layer's purpose and capabilities
- Clear examples of optimal usage for each layer
- Integration patterns between layers
- Best practices for maintaining layer health

### 2. Multi-Instance Workflows
- Implementation of parallel processing patterns
- Coordination strategies between instances
- Conflict resolution approaches
- Performance optimization techniques

### 3. Metrics and Monitoring
- Simple, practical metrics for measuring system effectiveness
- Performance tracking methodologies
- Warning signs of system inefficiency
- Optimization opportunities

### 4. Meta-Language Development (Optional)
- If proven beneficial, design a simple meta-language for cross-layer communication
- Focus on practical utility over complexity
- Clear documentation and usage examples

## Success Criteria
1. Users can effectively utilize all memory layers
2. Multi-instance workflows are clear and practical
3. Performance monitoring is straightforward
4. Guide is comprehensive yet accessible
5. Examples are concrete and applicable

## Constraints
- Maintain simplicity where possible
- Focus on practical over theoretical
- Ensure all recommendations are implementable
- Keep overhead minimal
