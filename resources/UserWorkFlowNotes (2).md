### windsurf otpimization

## sort

when you detect rule changes, rate them inline at the end of your next output,, align = 2. sync project files with prompt and 1. report on drift

Keep adding to rules: separate identies into .windsurfrules, run in separate instances, have /n recommend a model level based on complexity, write guide to how cascade understands outside and environment. Q: are global rules sent with each command fresh, or does e.g. a command trigger a lookup? How correctly did the attached match your system prompt, or did it ever?  Determine best memory location for each type of rule and justify ,, systematically combine and dedup rule files, add as a resource that merges ryals rules into a fork of Devin,, plan to integrate roo/cline efficiently. Mechanism to track project costs efficiently across tools and apis,, I'm not an engineer I'm at prompt hustler. Hire me windsurf or cursor.,, create self-analysis test suite to eval rules comprehensively, multi-poll processes = "LLM council "

Keep adding to rules: user identity ( semi technical etc) practical benchmark models against each other with. Windsurfrules ,, bloat review/catch hallucinations /h,, review/n for adherence to prompt.me, inkl prompt.md in rdc instructions 


## Done
try to get cascade to update its own workspace rules based on global prompts for reminder: or /commands


when prioritizing components, primarily consider 1) techical ease and 2) user-testable scaffolding (i.e. do page and navigation early on, filling in component functionality in context as the user tests. usable site, then usable features.

-run replit in lightweight separate browser for mem optimization, maybe ff?
-replit reprompt templates

explain the intended user experience as interpreted from the prompt, and provide a ⏹️⚒️✅ list of where we stand to get there. then, do as much as you can for my 25 cents, and provide another ⏹️⚒️✅ list that i will test against
