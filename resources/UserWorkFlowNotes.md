### windsurf otpimization

## sort

	 

Determine best memory location for each type of rule and justify 

systematically combine and dedup rule files, add as a resource that merges ryals rules into a fork of Devin

plan to integrate roo/cline efficiently. Mechanism to track project costs efficiently across tools and apis 


create self-analysis test suite to eval rules comprehensively, multi-poll processes = "LLM council "

user identity ( semi technical etc) 







(unnecessary but cool) have /n recommend a model level based on complexity 


## Done
try to get cascade to update its own workspace rules based on global prompts for reminder: or /commands


when prioritizing components, primarily consider 1) techical ease and 2) user-testable scaffolding (i.e. do page and navigation early on, filling in component functionality in context as the user tests. usable site, then usable features.

### Replit optimization
-run replit in lightweight separate browser for mem optimization, maybe ff?
-replit reprompt templates

explain the intended user experience as interpreted from the prompt, and provide a ⏹️⚒️✅ list of where we stand to get there. then, do as much as you can for my 25 cents, and provide another ⏹️⚒️✅ list that i will test against
